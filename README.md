# Experimental

Somewhat comprehensive python implementation of AP2 receiver using **some
multi-room** features. For now it implements:

- HomeKit transient pairing (SRP/Curve25519/ChaCha20-Poly1305) - bit flag 48
- HomeKit non-transient pairing
- Some refinements for HomeKit interaction (e.g. managed/active flags)
- Persist device name and some HomeKit properties across restarts (just use the -m flag again to set the device name anew)
- FairPlay (v3) authentication and decryption of AES keys - the first and only Python implementation. Credit to @systemcrash for implementation.
- Receiving of both REALTIME and BUFFERED Airplay2 audio streams
- Airplay2 Service publication
- Decoding of all Airplay2 supported CODECs: ALAC, AAC, OPUS, PCM.
 Ref: [here](https://emanuelecozzi.net/docs/airplay2/audio/) and 
      [here](https://emanuelecozzi.net/docs/airplay2/rtsp/#setup)
- Output latency compensation for sync with other Airplay receivers
- ANNOUNCE and RSA AES for unbuffered streaming from iTunes/Windows
- Spotify (via AirPlay2) and other live media streams with AES keys.


For now it does not implement:
 - FairPlay v2
 - Accurate audio sync (PTP and/or NTP)

 It may never implement:
 - MFi Authentication (requires MFi hardware module)
 
**This code is experimental. This receiver does not expect to be a real receiver but a toolbox for learning/debugging all airplay protocols and related pairing/authentication methods.**

Latest additions:
 - Implement RTP buffer (manage FLUSHBUFFERED) : play/pause/timeline/playlist

Next steps:
 - PTP (Precision Time Protocol)
 - Remove all os specific code (Soft Volume management)
 - Sender (branch-sender) - Implementation
 - Implement RSA Authentication
 - Raspbian package
 - DACP/(+MRP?) Support
 - FairPlay v2 Support

## mDNS/ZeroConf

If you encounter strange errors like NonUniqueNameException, or Address already in use, 
and you run on macOS, you may have noticed that macOS and this app both try to send updates. 
[Here is a possible workaround](https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf/issues/967#issuecomment-949110570).


## Raspberry Pi 4

Install docker and then build the image:

```zsh
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t ap2-receiver .
```

To run the receiver:

```zsh
docker run -it --rm --device /dev/snd --net host --volume `pwd`/pairings/:/airplay2/pairings/ ap2-receiver
```

Default network device is wlan0, you can change this with AP2IFACE env variable:

```zsh
docker run -it --rm --device /dev/snd --env AP2IFACE=eth0 --net host ap2-receiver
```

## Docker Compose

Example Docker Compose
```zsh
cat << EOF > docker-compose.yaml

version: '3.8'
services:
 ap2:
   restart: unless-stopped
   network_mode: host
   build: .
   # In case we change from host mode and need to map ports.
   # ports:
     # - "7000:7000"
     # - "10000-10100:10000-10100/udp"
   volumes:
     - ./pairings:/airplay2/pairings/
   # devices:
   #  - "/dev/snd"
   environment: # All variables are optional.
     - AP2HOSTNAME=Airplay2
     - AP2IFACE=eth0
     - NO_VOLUME_MANAGEMENT=true
EOF

docker-compose up
```

## Debian

```zsh
sudo apt install -y libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev libavfilter-dev portaudio19-dev python3 python3-pip python3-pyaudio build-essential pkg-config git alsa-utils
git clone https://github.com/openairplay/airplay2-receiver.git
cd airplay2-receiver/
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv airplay2-receiver
cd airplay2-receiver/
pip3 install -r ../requirements.txt
pip3 install pyaudio
```


## macOS Catalina

To run the receiver please use Python 3 and do the following:

* Run the following commands

```zsh
brew install python3
brew install portaudio
virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3 proto
source proto/bin/activate
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
pip install --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/usr/local/Cellar/portaudio/19.6.0/include" --global-option="-L/usr/local/Cellar/portaudio/19.6.0/lib" pyaudio


python ap2-receiver.py -m myap2 --netiface=en0
```

## Windows

To run the receiver please use Python 3 and do the following:

* Run the following commands

```zsh
cd [WHERE_YOU_CLONED_AIRPLAY2_RECEIVER]
virtualenv airplay2-receiver
cd airplay2-receiver
.\Scripts\activate
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
pip install pipwin pycaw
pipwin install pyaudio

python ap2-receiver.py -m myap2 -n [YOUR_INTERFACE_GUID] (looks like this for instance {02681AC0-AD52-4E15-9BD6-8C6A08C4F836} )
```

* the AirPlay 2 receiver is announced as **myap2**.

Tested on Python 3.7.5 / macOS 10.15.2 with iPhone X 13.3 and Raspberry Pi 4
